                    DESIGNING A CULTURE OF DESIGN
                </div>
                <div class="speakers-detail">
                    Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, 
                    foosball tables, or a beer fridge, 
                    and it doesn’t end with neckties, PCs, or big corporations.
                    It’s the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs, 
                    and the motivations that enable good work to get done, 
                    or it’s what stifles a workforce. For design to be most effective
                    and for designers to feel valued, we need to work in a culture 
                    that embraces design and allows it to succeed.

                    <br><br>
                    In Aaron’s session he will explore how to recognize the traits 
                    of organizations that *get* design, both large and small. 
                    He will share what those teams, departments, and companies have that others don’t, 
                    and more importantly, how to begin to change your own workplace’s culture. 
                    Once you’ve worked within a culture of design it’s almost impossible to imagine 
                    yourself anywhere else.

                    Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only
                    with a combination of well-written narrative and effective 
                    storytelling technique. It’s the filmmaker’s job to put this
                    together. To do so they’ve developed processes, tools and 
                    techniques that allow them to focus attention, emphasize 
                    information, foreshadow and produce the many elements that 
                    together comprise a well-told story.

                    <br><br>
                    With this workshop, we’ll revisit the topic of using stories 
                    in design and expand on the technical aspects used in film to 
                    communicate. We’ll look at some tools used in film, such as 
                    cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards. We’ll consider 
                    why they’re used and how we might look to them for inspiration.

                    Adam Connor is a designer, illustrator and speaker passionate 
                    about collaboration, communication, creativity and storytelling. 
                    As an Experience Design Director with Mad*Pow, Adam combines 10+ 
                    years of experience in interaction and experience design with a 
                    background in computer science, film, and animation to create 
                    effective and easy-to-use digital products and services. 
                    He believes that no matter how utilitarian a tool is, at the 
                    core of its creation lies a story; uncovering that story is key
